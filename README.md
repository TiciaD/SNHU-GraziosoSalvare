# SNHU Grazioso Salvare
This repo contains a web application dashboard and CRUD module made with Python and MongoDB for my CS-340 Client/Server Development class at SNHU. The application is meant to help a rescue-animal training company more easily identify and categorize dogs from local animal shelters that fit certain profiles conducive to search-and-rescue training.

## Overview
Grazioso Salvare identifies dogs that are good candidates for search-and-rescue training. Grazioso Salvare looks for certain profiles in dogs to train and are seeking a software application that can work with existing data from the animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. Global Rain has contracted for a full stack development of this application, including a database and a client-facing web application dashboard through which users at Grazioso Salvare will access the database.

## Requirements
- Develop a database and a Python module enabling CRUD functionality for MongoDB
- Create a fully functional MongoDB dashboard that includes:
  - Interactive options to filter the Austin Animal Center Outcomes data set
  - A data table which dynamically responds to the filtering options
  - A geolocation chart and a second chart of your choice that dynamically respond to the filtering options
